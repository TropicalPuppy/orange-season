'Huh? Who are you?': ""
'Hundreds of new conversations.': ""
'Hurry up already.': ""
'Hurry up and find this bouquet if you want to have a chance. Unless you want to skip to the next bouquet?': ""
'Hurry up!': ""
'I actually hate fishing, but I don''t like buying fish from Chloe or Serge every single day.': ""
'I actually wanted to give it to someone else in exchange for something I need.': ""
'I almost cried of happiness when he said that.': ""
'I almost died yesterday. Nathalia''s cat jumped on my back while I was distracted reading a book. I felt like my soul was leaving my body.': ""
'I already expected as much.': ""
'I already gave a cake to all the kids in town, but I still have some more. Here''s one for you, <name>.': ""
'I already tamed a turtle.': ""
'I also make a very important note that in order to become a successful farmer you need to ship something everyday, no matter what happens.': ""
'I always have a good time chatting with Chloe. We never run out of things to talk about.': ""
'I always liked this, it''s a good source of energy. Thanks!': ""
'I always need a couple days to rest before I start working. I had to travel halfway through the world to come here.': ""
'I always start the day with some black tea. It gives me strength to face all the paperwork.': ""
'I always wanted to be a furniture designer. Raphael taught me the basics of it when he worked here a couple years ago.': ""
'I always wanted to know a witch in real life.': ""
'I am! And you are?': ""
'I am! It was a slow day, but I couldn''t wait to leave and grab something to eat.': ""
'I am! Raphael is helping me build the furniture that I design. I already have some of them ready, would you like to take a look?': ""
'I appreciate your concern... But let me be myself from now on, alright?': ""
'I barely ever talk with my dad since mom and I moved here. I tried to call him today, but he didn''t answer.': ""
'I bought a new blender from a salesman that showed up earlier. It''s much bigger than my old one, I think I''ll be able to make that Rainbow Juice now.': ""
'I brought bird feed.': ""
'I brought the ingredient you need for your cake recipe. One <var:karlCakeIngredientName>, right?': ""
'I brought you a farming handbook. Do you want me to go over it with you?': ""
'I came all the way here and you had nothing to ship, <name>? My dad will think I''m pulling a fast one to skip working.': ""

'I can add a second floor to your house if you bring me the following materials:': ""
'I can also upgrade your tools for you <color:important>if you bring me the materials and money<color:default>. Stop by anytime.': ""
'I can get her a job at my shop if that''s the problem.': ""
'I can imagine.': ""
'I can kiss you now.': ""
'I can put bird feed here.': ""
'I can see that. I couldn''t keep up with you at all back there. And your right kick is stronger than anything I''ve seen before.': ""
'I can tell by the way you speak that you don''t want to be there.': ""
'I can''t believe I lost. I''m supposed to be the best at this game.': ""
'I can''t believe I won! My father must be proud!': ""
'I can''t believe it! I was kidding when I said that! Hahahahaha!': ""
'I can''t believe my Horse won! After so many years I finally won this race!': ""
'I can''t believe this. I should have seen that coming.': ""
'I can''t carry anything else.': ""
'I can''t even tell the chickens apart anymore, so I won''t watch the race, but I like to come here when the whole town is together.': ""
'I can''t expand your house anymore. Not yet, at least.': ""
'I can''t fool you, right? I love eating those pizza slices. Thank you so much, <name>.': ""
'I can''t pick feed from the storage if my bag is full.': ""
'I can''t say I''m not surprised either. This place is huge! I never thought I would be winning the auction with the low bid I did.': ""
'I can''t wait for the party to start.': ""
'I can''t, this is a waste of time!': ""
'I couldn''t participate on the games, I would probably end up cheating if I did.': ""
'I did! I had a great idea for your farm!': ""
'I did! I think she won''t be bothering me anytime soon now.': ""
'I did! Thank you for your hard work!': ""
'I didn''t bring anything.': ""
'I didn''t have much of a choice, this is where I managed to get a farm.': ""
'I didn''t have time to make anything fancy for Candy Day, so I gave Richard a chocolate bar.': ""
'I didn''t know you could make your own ice cream.': ""
'I didn''t pay attention to Raphael''s chicken, because I never expected her to win, but I guess he did a good job raising her.': ""
'I do have one. Probably not for the reasons you expect, but I have it.': ""
'I do like my job, despite everything. I get to exercise and also get to see Nathalia.': ""
'I do. But I''ll only give it to you if you get me a <color:item>Pirate Diary</color>.': ""
'I do. I''ve been thinking of you all the time now.': ""
'I don''t care about the flowers, but my brother isn''t working today so I want to enjoy the day with him.': ""
'I don''t care. I won''t give it to you until I get to know you better.': ""
'I don''t expect to live in Orange Town for much longer. As soon as I find what I''m looking for I''m out of here.': ""
'I don''t follow.': ""
'I don''t have a chicken to enter the race, but Pom likes to see them running.': ""
'I don''t have any recipe yet.': ""
'I don''t have enough weeds to make hay.': ""
'I don''t have room on my backpack to store the milk.': ""
'I don''t have room on my backpack to store the wool.': ""
'I don''t know': ""
'I don''t know what Serge had in mind, but I can''t teach Devin how to be dedicated. That''s not something one can simply learn.': ""
'I don''t know why people enjoy the beach so much during hot days. It''s even hotter there.': ""
'I don''t know why, but I''ve been thinking about you a lot recently.': ""
'I don''t know. Maybe she hasn''t matured yet.': ""
'I don''t know...<wait>': ""
'I don''t like mondays. Even if I do the same work everyday, mondays always seem to last forever.': ""
'I don''t like that and I don''t take charity.': ""
'I don''t like the summer. The heat is too strong and I can''t even think straight, even with the air conditioner in my room.': ""
'I don''t like this, but since it''s a gift I promise I''ll try to eat it.': ""
'I don''t like you that way.': ""
'I don''t really care about candy day.': ""
'I don''t really care if people know I''m a witch or not, but I usually avoid mentioning it. I don''t want to cause any commotion.': ""
'I don''t really like that, but thank you anyway.': ""
'I don''t really like that, but thank you for your thoughts.': ""
'I don''t really like that, but thanks.': ""
'I don''t really think of you that way.': ""
'I don''t take charity, but that would be a terrible gift anyway.': ""
'I don''t take charity.': ""
'I don''t think Chloe sells this, but sure, let''s talk to her.': ""
'I don''t think I''ve seen you around here before. Are you a fan of mine?': ""
'I don''t think anyone can...': ""
'I don''t think she''ll be able to eat another one right now, but you can give her another fish tomorrow.': ""
'I don''t think that logic applies to animals.': ""
'I don''t want it now, maybe another day.': ""
'I don''t want that.': ""
'I don''t want to risk cutting down a tree that can still grow back.': ""
'I don''t work on the fields as much these days, but I can say it''s important to eat a lot so you don''t run out of stamina.': ""
'I drew an exotic table last night. I would like to show you, but I left it hidden in my room.': ""
'I enjoy waking up early and taking a very long walk around the town. It makes me feel good about myself.': ""
'I envy Nathalia sometimes. It feels like she eats even more sugar than me, but her body handles it much better.': ""
'I feel like eating some pizza. Do you think Chloe will make me one now?': ""
'I finally got that Wanted Poster that Benjamin wants.': ""
'I finally got the Mummy Bandages that Annie needs. What a journey this was.': ""
'I forgot to water the cabbages yesterday. Three of them have already died. I need to pay more attention so it doesn''t happen again.': ""
'I gave a chocolate bar to the kids and a cake to Nathalia. She loves some sweets, so she wouldn''t miss the chance of getting some today.': ""
'I get bored very easily, so I try to read a lot to keep my mind busy.': ""
'I get it.': ""
'I got Phi a horse shaped cake for candy day. Did you give her anything yet?': ""
'I got distracted drawing some ideas on my notebook and didn''t see a customer come in.': ""
'I got the Pirate Diary. Now I need to give it to Karl.': ""
'I got them in a car accident when I was a kid. I spent the whole summer in the hospital after that.': ""
'I got them.': ""
'I grew up in my grandmother''s kitchen, and one of the things I inherited was her love of cooking.': ""
'I guess I am... Let''s go!': ""
'I guess I can finally check that house and get some sleep.': ""
'I guess we are done here.': ""
'I guess we will have to wait until then.': ""
'I guess you''re right...': ""
'I guess...<wait><wait><wait> So how can we find him?': ""
'I had a lot of fun today. And I can tell that the chickens are happy too.': ""
'I had a real good time tonight, thank you for taking me out, <name>!': ""
'I had a really good dream last night...<wait> Hey, <name>. What do you dream about?': ""
'I had a spare cake around, do you want it?': ""
'I had more pending work than I thought, so I had no choice but to cancel my plans for today.': ""
'I had no luck today, but I won''t give up.': ""
'I had not. Viktor has been telling me about it since forever, but I never felt like coming here.': ""
'I had so much fun last time... I wanted to spend time with you again.': ""
'I had so much fun today!': ""
'I had to buy oranges from the grocery store every time. I was always running out of money because of it.': ""
'I had to stop to rest a little. You shipped too much today, <name>.': ""
'I hate those. Why would you want to give it to me?': ""
'I have <var:feedCount> bags of bird feed left. I can still add more.': ""
'I have <var:feedCount> bags of bird feed left. It should be enough for now.': ""
'I have <var:mailCount> new mail.': ""
'I have a large piece of land on the west side of your farm. It''s no good for crops, but you can raise all your animals there.': ""
'I have a lot of stuff to do today, but I just don''t feel like it.': ""
'I have an idea.': ""
'I have no idea what you have to do to train your chicken, but congratulations for doing it well.': ""
'I have no new land to sell you at the moment.': ""
'I have no new mail.': ""
'I have nothing else to say.': ""
'I have one more thing to add to the table.': ""
'I have one new mail.': ""
'I have one. It''s called Turtle.': ""
'I have seen him going around with a list of people and food names, but I don''t know what he has in mind.': ""
'I have the flowers.': ""
'I have the most boring job in the whole universe. What do you say we switch jobs for a day?': ""
'I have the sugarcanes.': ""
'I have them here.': ""
'I have to be careful during fall. The number of times I stepped on leaves and slipped is too embarrassing to reveal.': ""
'I have to be strong. I can''t let my grandpa''s anger affect me so much.': ""
'I have to go': ""
'I have to go now, see you later!': ""
'I have to tell you, I''m really upset with Viktor.': ""
'I have to walk all over town while making deliveries or receiving shipments. It never gets easier.': ""
'I have, yes. My name is Julia, I''m the mayor here in Orange Town.': ""
'I haven''t added anything new to that book in a while. What do you think I should write about next?': ""
'I haven''t heard from my parents in a while.': ""
'I haven''t seen it.': ""
'I heard Amanda managed to grow a <color:item>Chocolate Rose</color>. Can you believe it?': ""
'I heard that you once tried to run away from home, is that true?': ""
'I heard the big blue crystal is found on places with a lot of silver. That should narrow your search a bit!': ""
'I heard there''s a girl in the weather channel that looks just like me. I''d like to meet her someday.': ""
'I heard you are Stella''s cousin. I''ve met her before. I''m a farmer as well. The name is <name>.': ""
'I heard you can cook any simple pot recipe that way. Try making some tea or hot milk next time.': ""
'I heard you''re new in this town too. Did you move here by yourself? That takes some courage.': ""
'I help out at Brittany''s ranch and manage the store there. Stop by anytime you need to buy something.': ""
'I hid many different flower bouquets in this area. I''ll ask you to bring me some of them, one by one.': ""
'I hope <color:name>Devin</color> is not slacking around again. He needs to get serious about his work.': ""
'I hope I can make my brother build a snowman with me this year. He promised me he would.': ""
'I initially moved here because I was running away from her...': ""
'I invented something new last night: an automatic hammer.': ""
'I just can''t find the time to go mining with so much work to do on the forge.': ""
'I just can''t think of anything to send to my father.': ""
'I just don''t like how it tastes.': ""
'I just heard from Raphael that you''re not letting Cindy study anymore.': ""
'I just made a deal with Serge to receive a weekly shipment of assorted candies from the capital. I can''t wait to get my first box.': ""
'I just milked my best cow. It tasted delicious! When you treat your cows with love and respect, the quality of the milk will improve.': ""
'I just realized. The rain will make your farm much more plentiful, will it not?': ""
'I just remembered I promised a favor to Devin, I''ll come back later.': ""
'I just want you to sell me one of each kind of fish you catch.': ""
'I just wanted to let you unwind a little, like we did at the restaurant.': ""
'I just wanted to tell you something first.': ""
'I just wish I could see her again someday.': ""
'I just... I could never say no to her. Somehow she always managed to make me do anything she wanted.': ""
'I just... really love being surrounded with animals.': ""
'I keep getting distracted, but it''s how I have the best ideas.': ""
'I knew Devin had no chance, but I had hoped you would win this.': ""
'I knew it!': ""
'I knew it! My Pipin is the best chicken ever!': ""
'I knew it! Western is the best genre ever. I''m glad you see that too. We have to watch some movies together soon!': ""
'I knew you had it in you to become a great farmer! Your chicken is amazing.': ""
'I know I''m not a kid, but I deserve some candy too, right?': ""
'I know I''m not breaking my diet when I eat this, but I can''t help but feel like I''m overeating.': ""
'I know I''m weird. The other day I even heard some people calling me a robot because of the way I work.': ""
'I know a thing or two about magic. I''ve seen some of those tools in the past too.': ""
'I know everyone thinks I''m too lazy to do anything, but I like being nice to people.': ""
'I know his horse is way past his better days, but he''s hard working!': ""
'I know how it is. The forge takes all my time away and I can''t work on my hobbies either.': ""
'I know it''s friday, but you should still work hard during the day, so you can turn your farm into the best flower fields in the region.': ""
'I know people think I''m just a picky eater, but my problem is far bigger than that.': ""
'I know she was just being mean, but deep down I''m always afraid that she was right.': ""
'I know that. It''s just...': ""
'I know well enough how hard it is. Grandpa won''t let me get any other job, even now that he hired Billy.': ""
'I know you will.': ""
'I know you''re just starting out and need to focus on making money, but flowers are important too.': ""
'I know you''re taking good care of your animals, so keep competing and you''ll eventually win.': ""
'I know, but I need a perfect one, so it would probably take me a long time looking for many different sticks until I can find the one.': ""
'I know, but there''s always something like that with me. I can never just eat what''s available.': ""
'I know...<wait> But he''s only here today because our parents want to control everything I do.': ""
'I learned it just for today! I hope it turned out all right.': ""
'I left him a message. I hope he''ll call me back.': ""
'I like it here. It''s a small and peaceful town, but it has everything I need.': ""
'I like living in Orange Town. You can clearly see the difference between seasons. It wasn''t like this in the city.': ""
'I like taking a good walk around town to see how the villagers are doing. Seeing everybody''s satisfaction is my payment!': ""
'I like that about him, but he will never reach the same numbers as us without changing the way he does business.': ""
'I like to drink a glass of wine everyday at lunch, but I always need to ask Serge to import some for me. Why is nobody making wine in this town?': ""
'I like to walk around the town. I get a chance to talk with many different people.': ""
'I like you too': ""
'I like you too!': ""
'I like you too.': ""
'I lost again. I really thought this time things would be different...': ""
'I lost it to the bank a couple years ago, but I''ve already changed my life. I''m working to get enough money to buy it back from you now.': ""
'I love Orange Town...<wait> But the winter colors are too depressing.': ""
'I love spring! It''s like seeing life overcoming every challenge.': ""
'I love that! Can I keep it?': ""
'I love the colors of this season, but I don''t like that the days are getting colder. I miss the summer already.': ""
'I love to read, but some days I just can''t decide which book to pick.': ""
'I love weekends. I get some rest from the heavy work and focus on the paperwork instead.': ""
'I made a few snowballs today, just to be safe. Nobody will be throwing any at me without getting twice as many back.': ""
'I made a huge research about the past of Orange Town, but he insists that everything about it is wrong.': ""
'I made some ice cream for dessert!': ""
'I managed to deliver my project at the last minute yesterday. Nothing like a good deadline to pressure us into being productive.': ""
'I managed to lift part of the spell so you can go back through the path you came in, but I can''t do much more than that.': ""
'I mean, what kind of farmer takes sass from carrots and potatoes? Spare the root and spoil the chili, that''s what I always say.': ""
'I mean... You don''t need to water your crops on rainy days.': ""
'I need her working on the farm. Besides, this has nothing to do with you two.': ""
'I need more time': ""
'I need something to take my mind out of my life problems, you know?': ""
'I need to find some new hobby. Some new excuse to stay indoors all day enjoying my air conditioner on the hot days.': ""
'I need to go clean myself better, I even got tomato juice under my nails.': ""
'I need to go see Ilda. I shouldn''t let my work drift me away from my friends.': ""
'I need to keep track of how much candy Phi will get tomorrow. I can''t let her eat it all at once.': ""
'I need to pay more attention at work so I don''t make any more mistakes.': ""
'I need to think of a good revenge plan against <color:name>Phi</color>.': ""
'I need to work. I can''t allow my sisters to be better than me.': ""
'I never expected both of us to lose this competition.': ""
'I never thought so many people would be figuring me out here. It never happened anywhere else.': ""
'I noticed you found yourself a sickle. It will be very useful in the farm.': ""
'I often stare out the window at night, hoping to see a mischievous Saci doing his thing.': ""
'I once read a whole book of chicken facts. Did you know they have more bones in their necks than giraffes?': ""
'I only started working as a carpenter here two months ago. I''ve had many different jobs before, even as a farmer.': ""
'I promised to deliver some stuff from my job tomorrow, but I haven''t even started it. I think I''ll buy some soda. The sugar will help me work.': ""
'I really like that you''re here. Orange Town needs more dreamers.': ""
'I really love winter. It makes my soul happier.': ""
'I really won? I''m as surprised as everybody else.': ""
'I remember one of them once slipped on a broken egg and ended up with a broken leg.': ""
'I ruined my breakfast again! Do you think you could ask my brother to make me a sandwich? He makes the best sandwiches ever, but I will never admit that to him.': ""
'I said I could take care of the Saci, but she insisted on it, so I gave her some money to go buy the bottle.': ""
'I saw a flower unbuttoning yesterday. It''s boring and takes too long.': ""
'I saw her up in the mountains, near some dead trees.': ""
'I see you managed to fix my old axe. Don''t go around cutting every tree in the forest now, alright?': ""
'I see. If it were me, I would be dropping everything to work on something I like.': ""
'I see. So you''re not after me. And trading something you need is a wise move. I will do the same!': ""
'I see. Well, if you''re going to be hanging around those parts, let me introduce myself and also give you a warning.': ""
'I see...': ""
'I see.<wait><wait> That does make sense.<wait>': ""
'I sent a letter to Melissa telling her to go graze in another field.': ""
'I should take this Chocolate Rose to Nathalia before it melts.': ""
'I should take this to Amanda before I pass out from the smell.': ""
'I shouldn''t have to work on sundays, but I still do it. At least this way I''m training even harder to be a better farmer.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Benjamin''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Bonnie''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Julia''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Lucas'' crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Mia''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Nathalia''s crops.': ""
'I shouldn''t mess with Serge''s crops.': ""
'I showed my drawing to Raphael and he said it was a pretty good design for a beginner.': ""
'I sold Billy some of my most sturdy flowers and he still managed to let them die in just a couple of days.': ""
'I specially didn''t think I would be getting close to people, as I''m only here temporarily.': ""
'I still feel bad whenever I''m unable to eat something.': ""
'I stopped to rest a little bit. It''s a long way between your farm and the store.': ""
'I tell you, sometimes I think he wants to see me die.': ""
'I think I don''t need to know any details about that. Can you lend me a piece?': ""
'I think I had too much sugar yesterday. I should be more careful of what I eat.': ""
'I think I know who''s going to win the race today. I''ll tell you later if I got it right.': ""
'I think I left it there, near the entrance.': ""
'I think I''ll be coming here often from now on.': ""
'I think I''ll go drink something with Benjamin. He should have some free time today so we need to make good use of it.': ""
'I think I''ll try to cook it too. I wonder if I can make it right. Thank you so much for the gift, <name>!': ""
'I think I''m out of the loop here. What happened with you and the farm?': ""
'I think I''m starting to like you. And I wanted to know if you like me back, despite my flaws.': ""
'I think I''ve said too much!': ""
'I think she''s addicted to adrenaline. I''ve never seen her relaxing.': ""
'I think so... Yeah. I can ask him to lend you the book.': ""
'I think there''s a witch or a wizard living secretly in this town, but I couldn''t determine who it is yet.': ""
'I think today I''m gonna spend the day fishing.': ""
'I think we have enough flowers now.': ""
'I think we should explore the mountains. Maybe we can find a magical being?': ""
'I thought there was going to be free food here today.': ""
'I thought you were going to participate. Don''t you have a chicken?': ""
'I told <color:name>Phi</color> that eating mango with milk can kill you. I may have ruined her favorite snack.': ""
'I told her about you on my last letter. She''s happy to know that there are a lot of people my age here.': ""
'I told you, I like being a farmer.': ""
'I too, want to be more than a friend.': ""
'I tried to cut the dead cabbages on the farm yesterday, but accidentally cut the ones that were still growing. If things continue like this, there will be no crops left to harvest.': ""
'I tried to look into him so many times, but I have no clue where he even came from.': ""
'I tried to tell you, I was just doing something nice.': ""
'I tried to, but I always get lost, so I didn''t get very far.': ""
'I try to always look out for the good things in life instead of complaining about the bad ones.': ""
'I understand. I''ll be back when I get a new opportunity for you. See you later.': ""
'I understand... And thank you for still being my friend.': ""
'I used to eat too much cake. Sometimes I would eat three whole cakes per week. One day I decided I needed to slow it down, so I turned wednesdays into cake days.': ""
'I used to think it would be cool. I had no idea how much work it is.': ""
'I usually go to the mountains to train new dance moves where nobody is watching.': ""
'I usually lose seven, but I once managed to harvest 5 whole turnips from a box with 10 seeds. It''s my personal record.': ""
'I usually teleport to the forest entrance so that people won''t freak out when I show up in the middle of town.': ""
'I wanna try grabbing a fish with my bare hands. It should be fun.': ""
'I want a <color:item>handcuff</color>.': ""
'I want the summer to come faster. The rivers are waiting for me.': ""
'I want to be your friend': ""
'I want to date you.': ""
'I want to get rich': ""
'I want to improve my cooking skills, so I picked a cookbook from the library yesterday. What recipe do you think I should try first?': ""
'I want to know why can''t you leave Chloe alone?': ""
'I want to make a new magic wand, but I want it to be perfect. For that I''ll need to have a good wooden stick to begin with.': ""
'I want to make you a Magic Ribbon. If I do, you will be able to use teleport magic, just like me.': ""
'I want to understand why my brother did everything that he did.': ""
'I want to work hard': ""
'I wanted to go ice skating, but I would probably get hurt.': ""
'I wanted to grow some flowers... At least I would have something to gift Bonnie or Raphael.': ""
'I wanted to read a new pirate book, but <color:name>Nathalia</color> gets mad that I don''t return the books, now I can''t borrow them anymore.': ""
'I wanted to show you that you''re not a robot.': ""
'I wanted to spend time with you': ""
'I wanted to thank you for being a good friend.': ""
'I was a bit anxious when I noticed I had a new letter on my inbox today, but it was just my aunt Dulce wanting to know how I''m doing.': ""
'I was actually wondering about that...': ""
'I was feeling a bit down after that, but Chloe managed to cheer me up now.': ""
'I was just a small kid when I ran away, even younger than you are now. And dad found me just two days later.': ""
'I was just wondering if you want to hang out.': ""
'I was never taught how to react to this, but thank you very much, <name>!': ""
'I was only trying to have some fun, I never thought I would win the games!': ""
'I was passing by and thought I would say hello.': ""
'I was so embarassed in the parking space. I knew nobody would talk to us. I would have no chance with the ladies.': ""
'I was super excited about this new project I''m working on, but he listed several flaws and kept talking about how to make it better.': ""
'I was thinking about summoning my sister to do some paperwork at the town hall. She no longer does the heavy work on her farm anyway.': ""
'I was thinking of procuring some new books for the library... What titles should I prioritize? It''s such a dilemma...': ""
'I was trying to make mayo with today''s eggs from the farm. Should be super simple right? Just put some oil and an egg on the blender.': ""
'I was walking on the mountains until I saw a little girl crawled there, holding a strainer against the ground.': ""
'I will buy when I get the money.': ""
'I will, thank you so much!': ""
'I wish I could be in the city. They have movies and also a big harbor there.': ""
'I wish I could be strong like her.': ""
'I wish I could be working on something else.': ""
'I wish I could stay in bed all day long.': ""
'I wish I could talk to animals...<wait><BR>Imagine all the things that animals would be able to teach us.': ""
'I wish I could use my time to work on my own projects instead.': ""
'I wish I had some work that involved creating something different. Something that really pushed my creativity.': ""
'I wish I had someone... who could help me become strong... Bonnie helps me a lot, but I need more...': ""
'I wish I was...': ""
'I wish my brother would stop working, at least on sundays.': ""
'I woke up with sore muscles today. I need to be more careful not to overwork too much, or my perfomance will be affected the next day.': ""
'I won''t be able to eat it anymore, it smells so bad! Maybe I should try to grow my own roses from now on.': ""
'I won''t drink it yet because it would make me sleepy, but thank you!': ""
'I wonder how he knows that white roses are my favorite.': ""
'I wonder if I can find a new place to build another garden. Julia probably won''t mind.': ""
'I wonder if anyone in Orange Town can fix this broken axe I found.': ""
'I wonder if we can use some of those flowers to decorate the chicken festival later this month.': ""
'I wonder what <color:name>Chloe</color> will do for lunch today. I''m getting hungry just thinking about it.': ""
'I wonder what kind of creature could have put it there. It was not done by any witch.': ""
'I wonder what tomorrow is holding for me.': ""
'I wonder why they do... It tastes so bad.': ""
'I worked a lot this week, I think I can take some time to myself. I wonder if Raphael wants to go out tomorrow.': ""
'I would be happy, at the very least. Thank you for the surprise!': ""
'I would be just like Cindy! The difference is that I would be my own Rory as well!': ""
'I would like a turtle too.': ""
'I would love to, but right now I got a lot of work to do.': ""
'I would love to, but right now I have to work.': ""
'I would not be myself anymore.': ""
'I would often have some good friends studying together and having pizza. My college time was quite fun.': ""
'I would rather be eating those tomatoes...': ""
'I would spend even more time with her if I could, but I''m already ashamed of how much I bother her.': ""
'I would stop to get to know you better, but I don''t have time. See you later.': ""
'I wouldn''t mind if it were a bit colder. I think the flowers could still endure it.': ""
'I''d be happy if we could count on you to join in on this habit as well.': ""
'I''d be trying to focus on my work and he would be constantly running around wanting attention.': ""
'I''d better stay away from the flowers. I don''t want to find any bees.': ""
'I''d imagine there''s a lot of people around here that don''t even know I live in this town. Not that I mind that.': ""
'I''d like to experience different cultures, and try different cuisine.': ""
'I''ll also give you some basic seeds so you can get started on your farm.': ""
'I''ll be going now. Make good use of it!': ""
'I''ll be keeping an eye on all participants. If anyone isn''t taking good care of their animals, I''ll know.': ""
'I''ll be rooting for Richard''s brother this year. Don''t throw any tomatoes on him, alright?': ""
'I''ll buy it.': ""
'I''ll come to your farm every day from now on to check if you have anything to sell.': ""
'I''ll continue to come to your farm every day to collect whatever you put in the shipping bin.': ""
'I''ll deliver your rooster when the festival ends.': ""
'I''ll do my best!': ""
'I''ll do that! It shouldn''t take me too long to get that many.': ""
'I''ll go take a walk in the mountains, see you later.': ""
'I''ll have to pay him a visit and chat a little, I''m curious how he''s like.': ""
'I''ll leave the new sprinkler on your mailbox when it''s finished.': ""
'I''ll pay you for the service, of course.': ""
'I''ll see if I can find anything.': ""
'I''ll show you something nice now, hang on.': ""
'I''ll start with those three.': ""
'I''ll start working on your house tomorrow. Look forward to it.': ""
'I''ll take a look once I''m ready with today''s work. It shouldn''t be too hard.': ""
'I''ll try to keep an open mind.': ""
'I''ll wait, but everyone else is ready so please don''t take long.': ""
'I''ll wait, but hurry please.': ""
'I''ll write down this recipe for <color:item><var:newRecipeName></color>.': ""
'I''ll... be careful. I promise.': ""
'I''ll...<wait><wait> check up on you later.': ""
'I''ll...<wait><wait> see what I can do.': ""
'I''ll...keep that in mind.': ""
'I''ll...try to catch a cold sometime.': ""
'I''m <color:name>Thalia</color>. I run the spa here in town. Feel free to drop by when you''re tired.': ""
'I''m <name>. I moved here to become a farmer.': ""
'I''m <name>. I moved in to that nearby farm.': ""
'I''m Billy, the previous owner of the farm you''re currently living on.': ""
'I''m Richard, why?': ""
'I''m a bit tired today, but I won''t let that prevent me from enjoying the sun.': ""
'I''m afraid to lose your friendship now, but there''s something that I need to tell you.': ""
'I''m already taking care of all your animals.': ""
'I''m already tired. I think I''ll go to bed soon.': ""
'I''m already working on your house. The job will be complete soon.': ""
'I''m always impressed at the number of large fish that can be found in this area.': ""
'I''m always thinking about the farm and all the work.': ""
'I''m always trying to draw new buildings or furniture, but it''s hard to think up of something.': ""
'I''m bored, but I don''t want to work.': ""
'I''m carrying a bunch of snowballs. <color:name>Phi</color> won''t know what hit her.': ""
'I''m challenging myself this month. I''m trying to grow as many flowers as possible without affecting the monthly goal for crops and animal products.': ""
'I''m colorblind': ""
'I''m constantly traveling so you won''t always find me at home, but I''ll try to come back to Orange Town every wednesday from now on.': ""
'I''m doing well. What about you?': ""
'I''m fine with going to the city, but do I really need to study?': ""
'I''m going home soon, so I won''t be seeing you for a while. Take good care of your farm, alright?': ""
'I''m going to change the flowers on my husband''s grave now.': ""
'I''m going to give Ilda some flowers, so she can put it on her husband''s grave.': ""
'I''m going to go grab something to eat before I go back home. Pom must be missing me so much.': ""
'I''m gonna assume that you also forgot to get yourself a <color:important>hoe</color> and give you an old one too.': ""
'I''m gonna cook without any utensil.': ""
'I''m good': ""
'I''m happy to have received something useful for my inventions, but even more for picking a gift she loved.': ""
'I''m happy to hear that she moved out of there as well.': ""
'I''m happy to hear that! Let''s have something together sometime.': ""
'I''m happy to hear that.': ""
'I''m happy to see you''re still around, <name>! Farming is not an easy job, a lot of people would''ve given up already.': ""
'I''m here everytime you need me!': ""
'I''m here this morning to present you with a unique opportunity.': ""
'I''m here today to bring you a small welcoming gift.': ""
'I''m just joking. Here''s the Ribbon, make good use of it!': ""
'I''m just messin'' with ya. My dad told me.': ""
'I''m just resting a little bit. I''ll be in your farm in a minute.': ""
'I''m looking forward to knowing you better, <name>!': ""
'I''m looking forward to watching some movies with you.': ""
'I''m lucky if anybody gives me anything at all. I would never expect flowers or gifts.': ""
'I''m making a special tool and there''s a very rare item that I need, but it may be a little unusual.': ""
'I''m new in Orange Town, my name is <name>.': ""
'I''m not': ""
'I''m not a big fan of dance clubs and that seems like a lot of trouble just to get to one.': ""
'I''m not a stranger--I live here on a farm. I''m <name>.': ""
'I''m not going to quit without trying.': ""
'I''m not keeping any of your animals.': ""

'Well, I know it''s a rookie mistake, but I was so distracted that I forgot to seal the blender lid. I panicked and somehow knocked down the blender.': ""
'Well, I suppose <color:important>you</color> can.': ""
'Well, here in Orange Town we are used to giving small gifts to our neighbors.': ""
'Well, if you''re confident already, I''ll be leaving now.': ""
'Well, maybe I can sell you a teleport spell someday, if I get to trust you.': ""
'Well, my name is <name>. What''s yours?': ""
'Well, now that winter is here all the weeds have already died, so you can leave that job for some other time, alright?': ""
'Well, of course I know that, but why?': ""
'Well, tell me one thing. Sweet or Savory?': ""
'Well, thank you for the wonderful night, <name>. You''re a great company. Let''s do this again sometime.': ""
'Well, that wouldn''t be fair, would it? I had a lot of work making it and you didn''t do anything.': ""
'Well, there''s always next year.': ""
'Well, this is awkward...': ""
'Well, well, well, what do we have here?': ""
'Well, you see...': ""

'What do you want?': ""

'What would you call your horse if you had one?': ""
'What would you like today?': ""
'What''s most important...?': ""
'What''s so good about chickens anyway?': ""

'Why did she have to leave? Now he yells at me twice as much as before...': ""
'Why did you lose? You should train your chicken better.': ""
'Why didn''t you enter the race too, <name>?': ""

'With this, fish will swim towards the bait when they are close to it.': ""
'With you here, the meeting with the town farmers will be a bit different. It won''t be a family meeting anymore.': ""
'Woah, really? How does it work?': ""
'Woah, you managed to get a golden egg? That''s not a feat any farmer can achieve. And to be giving it to me as a gift... Thank you so much.': ""
'Work for Rory': ""
'Work hard enough and you''ll get ahead with a little bit of luck. And by luck, I mean work. You make your own luck in this life.': ""
'Working as a blacksmith is not too bad, but it''s kind of boring to have to make tools in the same way and shape every time.': ""
'Working hard is part and parcel of life as a farmer, but if you push yourself too hard and run out of stamina, <color:important>you''ll collapse<color:default>.': ""
'Working on that farm must be doing wonders for your health and your body.': ""
'Working on the farm probably takes most of your time, right? I appreciate that you take some time to come talk to me.': ""
'Working when you''re tired will use up more stamina than normal, so you should go to bed early that night. Unless you''re looking for an excuse to come see me in the clinic.': ""
'Would that be possible? That''s amazing!': ""
'Would you laugh at me if I told you that I only moved to Orange Town because I love <color:item>orange juice</color>?': ""
'Would you like anything else?': ""
'Would you like to give us your opinion, <name>?': ""

Yes: ""

Yes!: ""
'Yes! And I even used those words.': ""
'Yes! Exactly who I thought was going to win.': ""

'Yes, 10 jasmines just like I wanted. Here''s your money and a nice reward.': ""
'Yes, I also like you a lot, Benjamin!': ""
'Yes, I can find those for you, but what kind of project are you going to make?': ""
'Yes, I got it.': ""
'Yes, I have it.': ""
'Yes, as soon as my brother grow old enough to take care of himself.': ""
'Yes, but I''m only here for the summer. My name is Duke.': ""
'Yes, let''s start.': ""
'Yes, like the Chicken Festival that we hold every spring on the 18th! If you win first prize on it or any other contest, your farm brand will be recognized for it.': ""
'Yes, please!': ""
'Yes, please! We''re all finished with today''s work already!': ""
'Yes, that is exactly what I need. Here''s your reward.': ""
'Yes, that''s the one.': ""
'Yes, this is the kind of crystal we need.': ""
'Yes, you already told me about her.': ""
'Yes, your grandfather mentioned you.': ""
Yes.: ""
'Yes. A <color:item>Wanted Poster</color>.': ""
'Yes. For example, I have a machine that can turn weeds into hay. It was a bit expensive, but it''s very useful.': ""
'Yes. He''s not really a bad guy and doesn''t mean any major harm. But there''s no minor harm that he won''t do.': ""
'Yes. I sell seeds and animals from Grandpa''s farm, but at least I don''t work on the fields anymore. We have Billy for that now.': ""
'Yes. I''m not sure if you''ve heard, but Brittany''s farm is now considered one of the most productive farms in the country.': ""
'Yes. That''s just one of his powers. Nobody ever managed to catch him because of it.': ""
Yes...: ""
'Yes... I didn''t take my eyes off of you either.': ""
Yes...<wait>: ""

'You could have been more creative.': ""

'You did a great job <name>, but don''t let it get over your head.': ""
'You did, but it''s different now.': ""
'You didn''t even try to race?': ""
'You do deliveries and I switch your job with someone else.': ""

'You don''t have any animal that I can take care of.': ""
'You don''t have enough money.': ""
'You don''t need to bother about me. I try not to get in the way of anybody.': ""
'You don''t need to work all day long like Stella to be successful!': ""
'You don''t need to worry about that, Lucas. I like you just the way you are.': ""
'You don''t understand. But it''s fine, I''ll go with Benjamin again.': ""
'You don''t want it? That''s ok.': ""
'You focused all your attention at me...<wait> Even though you''re not into soccer.': ""
'You found a cheap hammer!': ""
'You found a cheap sickle!': ""
'You had never seen Gabriel dancing before?': ""
'You had never seen the sea at night?': ""
'You have a finite amount of energy to do farm work. Watering crops, chopping wood, tending to you animals — all of those things consume stamina.': ""
'You have bought every kitchen utensil I had, so I decided to offer you the best items on my catalog.': ""
'You have no chance against me.': ""
'You jinxed me, <dude>.': ""
'You just aim it at what you want to hammer and press a button. It will automatically hit the target for as long as you keep the button pressed.': ""

'You know, Gabriel is the only person in Orange Town that I know nothing about.': ""
'You leave me speechless... Thank you! They are beautiful.': ""
'You lost your boots...': ""
'You lost? Are you sure you''re taking good care of your chicken?': ""
'You may even be able to find some useful tools there.': ""

'You really think so?': ""
'You should definitely buy a horse first thing. Horses are beautiful and awesome and riding is super-duper convenient.': ""
'You should eat at <color:name>Chloe</color>''s restaurant from time to time. Her food will give you the strength you need to do your work.': ""
'You should let her do what she likes.': ""

'You there! Do you know where Orange Town is?': ""
'You think so?': ""
'You want me to leave Chloe alone, right?': ""
'You want to give it to Nathalia, right? I''m willing to trade it.': ""
'You want to see if I''ll skip a day on my diet again, after so much pizza. Isn''t that right?': ""
'You were always nice to us, why wouldn''t we be nice to you as well?': ""
'You were right, she was right there! Thank you so much!': ""

'You will? Thank you so much, <name>.': ""
'You will? What a little darling you are.': ""
'You worry too much about that, Benjamin. How could you''ve known?': ""
'You wouldn''t find a worse gift even if you tried.': ""
'You youngsters know nothing about life. Do you think I should just let her live here for free?': ""
'You''ll be toiling from dawn to dusk every single day, rain or shine. I don''t want to hear any complaining from you either. If you''ve got time to complain, you''ve got time to shut up and work.': ""
'You''ll come see me when that happens, right? It won''t be cheap, but I''ll fix you up good as new.': ""
'You''ll find someone.': ""
'You''ll make me blush. What should I do when I receive something I love?': ""
'You''re as much a farmer as I am, maybe even more. Certainly more than Billy is.': ""
'You''re flesh and bones just like me.': ""
'You''re giving me a diamond? Wow, thank you so much, <name>! I love it.': ""
'You''re going to give me a lot of work, aren''t you?': ""
'You''re going to sleep? I''ll go home then.': ""
'You''re just starting out, right? You should try to find more tools.': ""
'You''re lucky. The nature is doing your work for you today. I don''t get the same chance with my job.': ""
'You''re making a lot more effort to talk to me than most people do. Are you trying to be my friend?': ""
'You''re no fun.': ""
'You''re not a kid in school anymore. Now you get a chance to befriend people that like you for who you are.': ""
'You''re painting this much worse than it is. I don''t think anyone would mind making something extra for you.': ""
'You''re really excited today, aren''t you?': ""
'You''re right. Let me check the list of materials...<wait>': ""
'You''re thinking of moving away from Orange Town?': ""
'You''re very considerate, we can''t deny that, but I have to go now! I need to fill this potbelly.': ""

'You''ve been living here for a while now, but I feel like I don''t know you that well yet.': ""

'Your chicken ran so fast in there. Near the end I thought she was going to jump to your face and peck your eye out.': ""
