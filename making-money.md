There are two main ways to get money in **Orange Season**. Those are *shipping items* and *completing quests*.

# Shipping Items

Almost every item you collect can be sold for profit using the **shipping bin**, located at the northern exit of your farm.

Interacting with it allows you to place items inside, and **[Devin](/villagers/Devin)** will collect those every day at 8 AM. When he collects the items, he'll pay you automatically for everything.

# Completing Quests

The villagers in **Orange Town** will give you quests, either showing at your doorstep in the morning or sending a letter. The quests are composed of one or more objectives, that when concluded can reward the player with **items**, **friendship** or **money**.

But if you want to get fetch quests directly, the quest board next to the INN will have random quests for you. Those are optional, but are another source of money.
